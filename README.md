# Code and Coins Portfolio ft Bootstrap

## Description

The motivation behind this portfolio was to showcase the skills and talents acquired so far in the bootcamp with the help of Bootstrap v4.6. I used navbar, jumbotron and cards.
I decided to build this project to track what I learnt so far and to update the portfolio with all the applications that I create each week.
